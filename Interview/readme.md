### Answers

9.  How browser understand the jsx


JSX is not natively understood by browsers. Instead, it needs to be converted into valid JavaScript using tools like Babel. This process is known as transpilation, which ensures that browsers can properly interpret and run the JSX code embedded within React applications.
